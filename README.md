# Hi there, I'm Dario Balboni ðŸ‘‹

I'm a curious person with broad interests, always eager to dive into intellectually challenging projects that push my learning boundaries. I love working on ideas that have the potential to create a real-world impact.

I approach each project with a deep curiosity about how things work and how they can be improved. What excites me most is the potential of curiosity to spark innovation and push the boundaries of understanding. I typically start a project when I feel a â€˜scratching itchâ€™ about the current way a system is laid outâ€”when something feels off or inefficient. That itch drives me to reimagine the problem, exploring new perspectives and creating more effective solutions.

One of my passions is exploring and studying the design of programming languages. Iâ€™m particularly fascinated by how language design influences the way we think about problems and develop solutions. Some of my favorite languages from a design perspective include Haskell, LISP, REBOL, Pony, E, Erlang, Python, Smalltalk, and Zig.

I also enjoy tinkering with distributed systems and novel data structures (have you seen the type of prolly trees used by Dolt?), as well as exploring cutting-edge deep learning research, which is the focus of my PhD.

In terms of software, I have a deep appreciation for stable and well-crafted tools. Some of my favorites include SQLite, Emacs, Kubernetes, Fossil SCM, and pretty much everything created by Fabrice Bellard. I also follow with great interest the experimental projects coming out of [Ink & Switch](https://www.inkandswitch.com/). Beyond these, my favourite frameworks are SvelteKit, Django, and PyTorch for their unique take on their intended usage.

I like to contribute to open source projects by providing feedback, suggestions, and solutions through issue discussions. One of my significant contributions has been in the [ZeroNet project](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+involves%3Atrenta3+), which revolves around decentralized websites.
